# Overview

Data Analysis comprehends different data processes required to obtain information, these processes include reading, organizing, and analyzing large amounts of data, looking for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets. For this project, we want to show how to use basic commands of Python libraries and explain little details to consider while processing the data we are working with.

Focusing on how Data Analysis can be applied to obtain relevant information in the healthcare field, we selected [healthcare_dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadfurqan0/unlocking-healthcare-trends-data-analysis/input) dataset

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
