# Overview
Data Analysis comprehends different data processes required to obtain information, these processes include reading, organizing, and analyzing large amounts of data, looking for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets. For this project, we want to show how to use basic commands of Python libraries for statistical projects and data analysis work, such as Panda, Matplotplib, and data writing with PyPDF2, and explain little details to consider while processing the data we are working with.

Focusing on how Data Analysis can be applied to obtain relevant information in the healthcare field, we selected [healthcare_dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadfurqan0/unlocking-healthcare-trends-data-analysis/input) dataset, available in Kaggle website.

The purpose of this little project is to explain how Python libraries for Statistical analysis can provide functions for plotting, searching, and displaying statistical results.

# Data Analysis Results

**Question 1:** *What was the medical condition(disease) ?* 

**Question 2:** *How many cases of Female and male patients with Diabetes between 2023 and 2024?* 


# Development Environment

Programming Language: Python 3.13.0
Editor: Visual Studio Code 1.97.0
## Libreries

- pypdf2 24.2
- matplotlib
- pandas
- os
- DateTime

## Resources:
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/creating-modifying-pdf/)

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/categorical_variables.html)

* [Multiple plotting](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/csd_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-lines-bars-and-markers-csd-demo-py)

# Future Work
As you can notice version 1.1 provides functions for specific questions for specific columns to analyze. future version will update functions show_plot() to be able to work receiving more than two columns. searching methods will also be modified to work with searching combinations that work with big volumes of data.
